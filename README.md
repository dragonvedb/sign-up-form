# sign-up-form

27th of February:

Finally starting on the next project. Calculator one feels like an eternity ago, even though I basically just finished it.
The mock-up provided doesn't seem too complicated. Honestly sometimes I feel like the hardest part of creating layouts is choice paralysis, because there are SO many ways of doing the same thing, and I have no idea which ones are better/more stable.

4th of March:

I think it's done. The instructions explicitly said to not bother making the mobile version, so I didn't. Maybe I'll return to it later. The site is pretty responsive anyway, clamp() and max() functions are just a godsend.
I'm also pleased with the design and the color palette. The page looks like it could actually exist in some parallel universe.
Also I managed to get password confirmation working. Initially looked into Validation API or whatever, but it was to much, so what I did was just write one JavaScript function that updates the 'pattern' attribute with whatever is in the password field. Seems to work OK.
